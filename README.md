## Introduction

Insurance fraud steals at least $308.6 billion every year from American consumers. Out of which, auto insurance scams cause $29 billion of damage to auto insurers annually. Around 78% of American citizens worry about insurance fraud. Automotive insurance fraud involves someone deceiving an insurance company about a claim involving their personal or commercial motor vehicle. It can involve giving out misleading information or providing false documentation to support the claim.

## Project Motivation
Our project aims to act as a first line of defence to identify and flag out fraudulent insurance claims as soon as they are submitted to insurance companies. This allows insurance companies to investigate more on potential fraud insurance claims and possibly reduce the loss that insurance companies incur from such fraudulent claims. This can potentially act as a deterrence to fraudsters from committing dangerous acts for the monetary gains from insurance scams.
